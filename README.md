# TeamProfileGenerator

## Description 

For this module you will generate a team of employees. Input the required information about the employee, then select a role.

Once a role has been selected, another question that is specific to that role will prompt the user. 

After all questions are answered the user will be prompted to continue generating employees by answering "YES" or finish the process by selecting "NO".

When the process is finalized a HTML file will be created with the information of the employees.
